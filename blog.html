                <h2 style="font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace);">I Really Thought I Had That One..</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace);">27-7-2023</p>
                <p>Rejection hurts, and the closer you were to something the greater the pain will be. Life coaches and motivational speakers often wax lyrically about failure, and how it is a healthy sign of development, an essential part of life itself, but very few if any even touch the subject of rejection.</p>
                <p>We can all see why, failure is logical, it can be observed, studied, and rationalized. Those folks with the freshly pressed shirts and $200 haircuts are right in its an a essential part of starting and learning anything. You should always expect a degree of failure when embarking on any task.. it's nothing to be afraid of.</p>
                <p>Rejection on the other hand is nothing short of a kick in the teeth, just like failure it can be expected, but no good comes from revisiting it, and at times it won't even make sense. For example, say you decided to sign up to a Gym with the goal of getting in shape! You go in on your first day and only get through half your exercises, you've failed, badly it seems but you're not upset. You're not upset because to a degree you expected it, and looking back at some of your sets you can see glaring mistakes and room for improvement. You've learned what not to do and can take that with you knowing you'll do better another time. Now imagine you sign up, but just before you get to the front door a staff member comes out and says you cant go in. The reason? You don't know, or you're not sure why, but they're turning you away. "You're a nice person and all and have the skills and motivation to get healthy, but I'm sorry.. you'll have to try somewhere else". What are you supposed to learn from that?</p>
                <p>Nothing, and it'll hurt like hell.</p>
                <p>Some people think this is because rejection is beyond your immediate control, others think its a mental holdover from when we were developing as a species the pain being an instinctual reminder to get with the program and conform. But regardless of its cause, it'll always be painful in a way failure isn't, and that kind of pain is hard to get rid of.</p>
                <p>Last and most potently of all is the difference in their cumulative effects. Repeated failure simply amplifies what it was telling you before, this didn't work try again. It often forces you to dramatically change your approach to a goal, or shift and put your energy into something more achievable. Repeated rejection tends the opposite, it chips away at you, bogs you down, makes you feel worthless across the board and start questioning yourself. If everyone is giving you a pass there must be some ugly part, sub-par part of yourself that you just don't see.</p>
                <p>Now why am I saying all of this? Three months ago I handed in my notice with the intention of fixing my body, and starting a career in something more pleasant. Every single application I have sent out has been rejected without interview, slowly chipping away. Until two weeks ago, an interview, meet the team, a followup questionnaire, and a second interview this was it!</p>
                <p>"You're a strong contender, and we don't have any feedback for improvements but I'm sorry.. you'll have to try somewhere else."</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace);">Far Flung Friends</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace);">21-10-2022</p>
                <p>As I approach the end of the year I’ve repeatedly noticed how calm things are, I haven’t got any major personal milestones coming up, no travel, no big life changes its just been smoothly gliding along. This tempo was set well before the pandemic, and worldwide “quiet night in” that followed, I’d just decided to slow down, curtail my ambitions and be small for a while.</p>
				<p>But I’ve started to get the itch again.</p>
				<p>Next year is already going to be one of tremendous personal change, but I want to push out further than that. I’ve been dying to see all my far away friends, see new vistas, try new things.. you know that typical white woman motivational stuff. But the first point still stands, my friends.. I have allot of them and New Zealand is so very, very far away from the rest of the developed world.</p>
				<p>So.. once I’ve been put back together again a round trip is in order.. I’ll bring beers..</p>

                <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace);">23-8-2022</p>
                <p>On today's episode of TMI Tuesday I get to share that I am in for three major bouts of surgery. A good portion of all three will involve having a large portion of metal grafted to my skeleton. Despite the fact that its going to make metal detectors fun for the rest of my life I'm not really worried about the outcome.</p>
                <p>What does worry me is the anesthesia..</p>
                <p>I've had surgeries before, long bouts of sleep, and even knocked myself unconscious. But for some reason I'm terrified of going under, of feeling myself slip off (assuming I even remember). As stupid as it sounds I've been preparing myself to "suddenly come to" in a recovery ward. Just like that, no dreams no memories, nothing.. I keep a dream diary for a reason, just having time vanish frightens me.</p>
                <p>Putting things in perspective though, I'm finally getting fixed. That will be incredible.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace);">Interloping</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace);">02-8-2022</p>
                <p>I've been getting headaches more and more the past few months. Not the kind that completely take you out, or cripple you, but the deep throb I used to get cramming or taking exams. They're happening with such frequency that I'm starting to divide my day around them, like shifting down a gear when you see a passing lane in the distance.</p>
                <p>I know why I'm getting them part of my job, most.. of my job revolves around the rapid accumulation of very specific knowledge. I have to be a trusted advisor, a font of wisdom for a myriad of small outfits all over the country. From lawyers to student unions, I have to have *just* enough knowledge of their world to connect all the pieces. Don't get me wrong, its one of the more enjoyable aspects, but after 6 years of doing this I can't but help feel like an interloper, all the outside 'knowledge' I've accumulated over the years is paper thin and can only be leveraged through trickery.</p>
                <p>Every once and a while I'll meet with an other engineer, or someone from a network engineering background, those days are nice, I don't have to contort myself.</p>

                <h2 style="font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace);">RAM OK, ROM OK</h2>
                <p style="font-size: 0.8rem; font-family: var(--bs-font-monospace);">18-7-2022</p>
                <p>It's time for a change of scenery..</p>
                <p>These last two years have been some of the most secluded of my life, yet at the same time have seen some of the most radical changes. New projects, new friends, and new horizons have kept me going through what can only be described as the mother of all quiet nights in. But now just as the world is waking up I thought it would be a good time to dust off this site into something more than just a badly made trick for keyparties. (which you can find <a class="not" href="v1.html">here</a> if you're morbidly curious)</p>
                <p>My main goal is to have this site grow along side me over the coming years. So long as I remember to update it.</p>
