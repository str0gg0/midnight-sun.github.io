                <p>I've been getting headaches more and more the past few months. Not the kind that completely take you out, or cripple you, but the deep throb I used to get cramming or taking exams. They're happening with such frequency that I'm starting to divide my day around them, like shifting down a gear when you see a passing lane in the distance.</p>
                <p>I know why I'm getting them part of my job, most.. of my job revolves around the rapid accumulation of very specific knowledge. I have to be a trusted advisor, a font of wisdom for a myriad of small outfits all over the country. From lawyers to student unions, I have to have *just* enough knowledge of their world to connect all the pieces. Don't get me wrong, its one of the more enjoyable aspects, but after 6 years of doing this I can't but help feel like an interloper, all the outside 'knowledge' I've accumulated over the years is paper thin and can only be leveraged through trickery.</p>
                <p>Every once and a while I'll meet with an other engineer, or someone from a network engineering background, those days are nice, I don't have to contort myself.</p>
