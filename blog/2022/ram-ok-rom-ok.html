            <p>It's time for a change of scenery..</p>
            <p>These last two years have been some of the most secluded of my life, yet at the same time have seen some of the most radical changes. New projects, new friends, and new horizons have kept me going through what can only be described as the mother of all quiet nights in. But now just as the world is waking up I thought it would be a good time to dust off this site into something more than just a badly made trick for keyparties. (which you can find <a href="/v1/index.html">>here</a> if you're morbidly curious)</p>
            <p>My main goal is to have this site grow along side me over the coming years. So long as I remember to update it.</p>
