            <h2>Far Flung Friends</h2>
            <br>
            <p>As I approach the end of the year I’ve repeatedly noticed how calm things are, I haven’t got any major personal milestones coming up, no travel, no big life changes its just been smoothly gliding along. This tempo was set well before the pandemic, and worldwide “quiet night in” that followed, I’d just decided to slow down, curtail my ambitions and be small for a while.</p>
            <p>But I’ve started to get the itch again.</p>
            <p>Next year is already going to be one of tremendous personal change, but I want to push out further than that. I’ve been dying to see all my far away friends, see new vistas, try new things.. you know that typical white woman motivational stuff. But the first point still stands, my friends.. I have allot of them and New Zealand is so very, very far away from the rest of the developed world.</p>
            <p>So.. once I’ve been put back together again a round trip is in order.. I’ll bring beers..</p>
