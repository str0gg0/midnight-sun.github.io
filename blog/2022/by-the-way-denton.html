            <h2>By the way, Denton</h2>
            <br>
            <p>On today's episode of TMI Tuesday I get to share that I am in for three major bouts of surgery. A good portion of all three will involve having a large portion of metal grafted to my skeleton. Despite the fact that its going to make metal detectors fun for the rest of my life I'm not really worried about the outcome.</p>
            <p>What does worry me is the anesthesia..</p>
            <p>I've had surgeries before, long bouts of sleep, and even knocked myself unconscious. But for some reason I'm terrified of going under, of feeling myself slip off (assuming I even remember). As stupid as it sounds I've been preparing myself to "suddenly come to" in a recovery ward. Just like that, no dreams no memories, nothing.. I keep a dream diary for a reason, just having time vanish frightens me.</p>
            <p>Putting things in perspective though, I'm finally getting fixed. That will be incredible.</p>
